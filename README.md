# Brainfuck Interpreter
This repository is a interpreter written in C for the esoteric programming language [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). 

# Version
If the current TAG version is less than 1.0, means that I am still working on it (of course). At the version v0.9 it is not __Turing Complete__ yet because I'm limiting my memory :)

# Details
I wanted to have my own interpreter for that language, since I might use it on future projects, for example on sending commands to an Arduino board (__1 BYTE COMMANDS!!!__).

I also might write a new esoteric language based on Brainfuck and/or translators for that as well.

### Usage
After compiling that (it was tested using __Clang 3.5__ and __GCC 4.8.4__), you just need to inform the .bf you want to execute:

__> ./brainfuck test.bf__
